I hope this message finds you well.

My name is Bodhit Tangri, and I am writing to express my keen interest in data science opportunities within your organization. With over four years of experience in risk analytics and decision science at American Express and a strong foundation in statistical modeling, machine learning, and anomaly detection, I believe I bring a valuable combination of technical expertise and strategic thinking.

Currently, I serve as a Senior Analyst in Risk Management, where I have led the development of a Trade-Based Money Laundering framework that increased true positive alert rates by 60%, and engineered detection techniques that improved fraud identification by 30%. My work consistently demonstrates an ability to derive actionable insights from complex data, automate processes, and build scalable solutionsâ€”all critical skills for a high-impact data scientist.

I am proficient in Python, SQL, PySpark, and BigQuery, and I hold certifications in Machine Learning and Advanced Data Analytics from Coursera. Iâ€™m particularly drawn to roles that merge data science with real-world problem-solving in financial or technology-driven environments.

I have attached my resume for your review and would welcome the opportunity to further discuss how I can contribute to your team. Thank you for considering my applicationâ€”I look forward to the possibility of connecting.

Warm regards,
Bodhit Tangri
